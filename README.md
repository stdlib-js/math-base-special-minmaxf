    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import minmaxf from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-base-special-minmaxf@esm/index.mjs';
```

You can also import the following named exports from the package:

```javascript
import { assign } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-base-special-minmaxf@esm/index.mjs';
```

#### minmaxf( x, y )

Returns the minimum and maximum of two single-precision floating-point numbers in a single pass.

```javascript
var v = minmaxf( 4.2, 3.14 );
// returns [ 3.14, 4.2 ]

v = minmaxf( +0.0, -0.0 );
// returns [ -0.0, +0.0 ]
```

If any argument is `NaN`, the function returns `NaN` for both the minimum value and the maximum value.

```javascript
var v = minmaxf( 4.2, NaN );
// returns [ NaN, NaN ]

v = minmaxf( NaN, 3.14 );
// returns [ NaN, NaN ]
```

#### minmaxf.assign( x, y, out, stride, offset )

Returns the minimum and maximum of two single-precision floating-point numbers in a single pass and assigns results to a provided output array.

```javascript
import Float32Array from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-float32@esm/index.mjs';

var out = new Float32Array( 2 );

var v = minmaxf.assign( 5.0, -2.0, out, 1, 0 );
// returns <Float32Array>[ -2.0, 5.0 ]

var bool = ( v === out );
// returns true
```
